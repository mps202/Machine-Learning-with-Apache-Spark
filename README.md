# Machine-Learning-with-Apache-Spark



Final Project - Build an ML Pipeline for Airfoil noise prediction
Estimated time needed: 90 minutes

Scenario
You are a data engineer at an aeronautics consulting company. Your company prides itself in being able to efficiently design airfoils for use in planes and sports cars. Data scientists in your office need to work with different algorithms and data in different formats. While they are good at Machine Learning, they count on you to be able to do ETL jobs and build ML pipelines. In this project you will use the modified version of the NASA Airfoil Self Noise dataset. You will clean this dataset, by dropping the duplicate rows, and removing the rows with null values. You will create an ML pipe line to create a model that will predict the SoundLevel based on all the other columns. You will evaluate the model and towards the end you will persist the model.

Objectives
In this 4 part assignment you will:

Part 1 Perform ETL activity
Load a csv dataset
Remove duplicates if any
Drop rows with null values if any
Make transformations
Store the cleaned data in parquet format


Part 2 Create a Machine Learning Pipeline
Create a machine learning pipeline for prediction


Part 3 Evaluate the Model
Evaluate the model using relevant metrics


Part 4 Persist the Model
Save the model for future production use
Load and verify the stored model
